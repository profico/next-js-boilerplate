# Profico Next.js Boilerplate

This boilerplate uses the same project structure as https://github.com/profico/react-boilerplate-vite as well as the same [style guide](https://github.com/profico/react-boilerplate-vite/blob/master/style-guide.md).

## Deployment

Easiest deployment would be using Docker for which the Dockerfile is already prepared.
